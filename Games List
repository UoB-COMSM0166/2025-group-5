**The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth (rogue-like)**

1. Game Introduction
When Isaac’s mother starts hearing the voice of God demanding a sacrifice be made to prove her faith,
Issac escapes into the basement facing droves of deranged enemies, lost brothers and sisters, his fears, and eventually his mother.

2. Basic Controls:
Character movements: WASD
Shooting and direct control: arrow keys

3. Game Objectives:
Control the character to shoot tears to eliminate all enemies in the room and earn rewards,
making the character stronger until defeating the final boss.

4. Game Rules
The character shoots tears to attack enemies.
After clearing a room, the player will often receive rewards,
which may include coins for shop purchases, keys to open specific rooms or chests, powerful bombs,
or items that can enhance the character's stats or alter their attacks.
While attacking, the player must avoid contact with enemies or their projectiles, as this will cause the character to lose hearts.
When the character loses all hearts, the game is over.
Alternatively, the game is won when the player defeats the final boss.

5. The Fun of the Game
As a roguelike game, The Binding of Isaac's randomness and progression are key features that attract many players.
In each run, players will encounter different room layouts and enemies, and will randomly receive various rewards and items.
This ensures that each playthrough is unique. Sometimes, players may be quickly defeated by small enemies, while other times they can easily one-shot the boss.
