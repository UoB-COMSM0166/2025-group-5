   - No leaderboard or score-saving feature is included.  

5. Game Progression:

6. Game Features:  
   - Simple and minimalistic design for easy accessibility.  
   - Randomly generated food positions ensure varied gameplay.  

7. Core Gameplay:  
   - Use quick reflexes and strategic planning to navigate the snake around the screen, avoiding collisions while aiming to achieve the longest possible snake!
