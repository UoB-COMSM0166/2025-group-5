## Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel?


**Dragon Adventure** is a story-rich 2D action-adventure game. Guided by an engaging narrative, players battle a variety of monsters to fulfill their story-driven objectives.

#### 🎮 Game Inspiration

The game is inspired by *Soul Knight*, a pixel-style dungeon adventure shooter that combines **roguelike** elements with **action shooting** gameplay. However, **Dragon Adventure** sets itself apart by shifting the focus away from flashy combat and a wide variety of weapons.

Unlike *Soul Knight*, which lacks a continuous storyline and emphasizes grinding for experience and resources to grow stronger, our game aims to offer a deeper, more immersive narrative experience.

#### 🧩 Our Design Philosophy

We want players to be truly immersed in the story — not just see the game as a combat playground. To achieve this, we've made several key design choices:

##### 1. Monster Abilities & Progression

While challenging players through cleverly designed maps and diverse monster types, we also allow players to **absorb a portion of a monster’s abilities upon defeating them**.

This system lets players grow stronger as they progress, while also revealing the nature of the world they’re in. It encourages creative strategy and adaptive play based on acquired abilities.

##### 2. Fog-of-War Vision System

A unique vision mechanic, tightly integrated with environmental design, creates a sense of mystery and exploration. The player navigates a world shrouded in fog, heightening their curiosity and pushing them to explore.

##### 3. Narrative-Driven Visual & Gameplay Design

We carefully crafted both the script and visual elements to align with gameplay mechanics. This synergy enhances the sense of immersion and supports the storytelling at every step.

### Requirements 
1. List of Stakeholders
•	Players: Expect a smooth gameplay experience and engaging challenges.
•	Development Team: Wants a clean and maintainable code structure for easy expansion.
•	Product Manager: Hopes the game is easy to understand and suitable for players of all ages.
•	Testers: Ensure the game is free from major bugs and runs stably.

2. Epics and User Stories
Epic 1: Core Gameplay
•	User Story 1.1 (As a player, I want to control the dragon’s movement so that I can survive longer in the game).
•	User Story 1.2 (As a player, I want the dragon to gain length when it eats food to increase the game’s challenge).
•	User Story 1.3 (As a player, I want the game to end if the dragon crashes into walls or itself, adding difficulty to the game).
Epic 2: Game Interface and Experience Optimization
•	User Story 2.1 (As a player, I want a score counter so that I can track my game performance).
•	User Story 2.2 (As a player, I want start, pause, and restart buttons for easier control).
•	User Story 2.3 (As a player, I want to choose different difficulty levels to experience different challenges).

3. Reflection
During the development of the Dragon Game, our team learned about epics and user stories and applied them to our requirements analysis. Here are our key takeaways:
1.	Breaking Down Epics and User Stories
o	Epics helped us understand the game’s core functionalities, while user stories allowed us to define specific details.
o	Initially, we only had the idea of "making a dragon game," but by breaking it down, we realized we needed to consider aspects like core gameplay, interface optimization, and additional features.
2.	Acceptance Criteria
o	While defining each user story, we also considered its acceptance criteria. For example, when the dragon eats food, it should gain health or receive buffs; otherwise, the feature would be incomplete.
o	This helped us realize that well-defined acceptance criteria provide clear development goals and reduce ambiguity.
3.	Contextual Analysis of the Game
o	Through analysis, we found that the game’s primary audience consists of casual players. Therefore, we needed intuitive controls and a user-friendly UI design.
o	Additionally, we considered features like an infinite mode to enhance competitiveness and engagement.
