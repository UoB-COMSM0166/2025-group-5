## Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel? 

### Requirements 
1. List of Stakeholders
•	Players: Expect a smooth gameplay experience and engaging challenges.
•	Development Team: Wants a clean and maintainable code structure for easy expansion.
•	Product Manager: Hopes the game is easy to understand and suitable for players of all ages.
•	Testers: Ensure the game is free from major bugs and runs stably.

2. Epics and User Stories
Epic 1: Core Gameplay
•	User Story 1.1 (As a player, I want to control the dragon’s movement so that I can survive longer in the game).
•	User Story 1.2 (As a player, I want the dragon to gain length when it eats food to increase the game’s challenge).
•	User Story 1.3 (As a player, I want the game to end if the dragon crashes into walls or itself, adding difficulty to the game).
Epic 2: Game Interface and Experience Optimization
•	User Story 2.1 (As a player, I want a score counter so that I can track my game performance).
•	User Story 2.2 (As a player, I want start, pause, and restart buttons for easier control).
•	User Story 2.3 (As a player, I want to choose different difficulty levels to experience different challenges).

3. Reflection
During the development of the Dragon Game, our team learned about epics and user stories and applied them to our requirements analysis. Here are our key takeaways:
1.	Breaking Down Epics and User Stories
o	Epics helped us understand the game’s core functionalities, while user stories allowed us to define specific details.
o	Initially, we only had the idea of "making a dragon game," but by breaking it down, we realized we needed to consider aspects like core gameplay, interface optimization, and additional features.
2.	Acceptance Criteria
o	While defining each user story, we also considered its acceptance criteria. For example, when the dragon eats food, it should gain health or receive buffs; otherwise, the feature would be incomplete.
o	This helped us realize that well-defined acceptance criteria provide clear development goals and reduce ambiguity.
3.	Contextual Analysis of the Game
o	Through analysis, we found that the game’s primary audience consists of casual players. Therefore, we needed intuitive controls and a user-friendly UI design.
o	Additionally, we considered features like an infinite mode to enhance competitiveness and engagement.
