## Project Report

### Introduction Áº∫Ê∏∏ÊàèÂÖÉÁ¥†‰ªãÁªçÔºåÂÖ≥Âç°Âõæ
**Dragon Adventure** is a story-rich 2D action-adventure game. Guided by an immersive narrative, players battle various monsters to complete story-driven objectives.  

---

#### üéÆ **Game Inspiration**  
Inspired by the pixel-style dungeon shooter *Soul Knight*‚Äîa game blending **roguelike** elements with **action-packed shooting**‚Äî**Dragon Adventure** carves its own identity by shifting focus away from flashy combat and weapon variety. Instead, it embraces a *"story-driven actions, actions shaping the story"* philosophy.  

Unlike *Soul Knight*, which lacks a continuous plot and emphasizes grinding for EXP/resources, our game delivers a **deeper, more immersive experience**. This is achieved through:  
- **Richly designed maps & enemies**  
- **Dynamic vision mechanics**  
- **Souls-like difficulty** to ensure engagement  

Guided by the narrative, players must **analyze enemy behaviors and map layouts** carefully to progress‚Äîgradually uncovering the world's secrets along the way.  

---

##### **Example: Gameplay in Chapter 2**  
After adapting to Chapter 1's challenges, players are **cursed by the final boss**, which logically restricts their **field of vision**. Forced to explore with **severely limited sight**, they soon realize the game's true depth:  
- A seemingly mandatory path requires defeating a **powerful monster** with **low HP**‚Äîcreating tense, strategic combat.  
- Our **"Transformation Mechanic"** offers temporary solutions (e.g., bonus HP/abilities) to balance despair with hope.  

---

Through **interconnected design**, *Dragon Adventure* ensures players **deeply engage** with our meticulously crafted world‚Äîone challenge at a time.  

### Requirements 

Our requirements engineering process consists of several key steps.

#### Identifying Stakeholders

The first step was to identify the stakeholders we aim to serve.  

<img width="336" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72548918-6fa0-43c9-a73b-b64e43cc9c6a" />

From this perspective, given our team‚Äôs scale and technical capabilities, our primary focus is to:  
**‚úÖ Deliver a distinct gameplay style and experience** to establish _competitive differentiation_ from other groups.  

While adhering to industry trends, we prioritize:  
**üîπ Honoring team members' creative preferences** ‚Äî A **shared vision** dramatically boosts development motivation and execution quality.  

#### Industry trend & Player Persona & Top-Level Needs

##### **Industry Context & Narrative Opportunity in Pixel Shooters**  

**Current Market Landscape:**  
Many pixel shooter games (e.g., _Broforce_, _Enter the Gungeon_, _Nuclear Throne_) focus on **fast-paced mechanics** and **progression systems**, often with **minimal narrative**:  
- **Broforce**: Criticized for having _"no comprehensible story"_ (Rock Paper Shotgun, 2015)  
- **Enter the Gungeon**: Framed around a single joke (_"a gun that can kill the past"_) with shallow plot (PC Gamer, 2016)  
- **Nuclear Throne**: Developers admitted to using only a _"bare minimum of backstory"_ (Edge Magazine, 2015)  

**Player Demand Shifts:**  
- **53% of gamers** now prefer single-player games for _story immersion_ (YouGov, 2024)  
- Players rank **"strong story & believable characters"** above graphics/combat (IBT, 2021)  
- Academic studies (Schott & Burn, 2020; Isbister, 2017) confirm narrative boosts **emotional engagement** and **retention**  

**Strategic Opportunity:**  
> _"Narrative immersion is now a competitive differentiator"_ ‚Äî J. Schell (2020)  

By combining **pixel shooter mechanics** with **interactive storytelling** (branching dialogue, meaningful choices), your game can:  
1. **Stand out** in a saturated indie market  
2. **Attract story-driven players** underserved by current offerings  
3. **Create deeper emotional investment** through character agency  

##### **Target User Profile Summary**

**Key Insights:** 
Our design addresses players who:

###### Priority Ranking

To ensure an effective and collaborative prioritization of our feature set, our team adopted the **Planning Poker** method. 
Each team member independently estimated the **value** (player impact) and **implementation effort** (development cost) of every feature based on its **acceptance criteria**. 
After discussing outlier scores and reaching consensus, we assigned final point values for both axes.

With those scores in place, we mapped each feature into a **2√ó2 priority matrix** structured by:

- **High vs. Low Player Value**
- **High vs. Low Implementation Effort**

This helped us visually identify features that are:
- ‚úÖ Core to the gameplay loop,
- üí¨ Supporting emotional engagement,
- üß© Providing gameplay depth without overburdening development resources.

Following the matrix, we produced two tables:
|                      | **Low Effort üõ†Ô∏è**                                                                                             | **High Effort üõ†Ô∏è**                                                                                              |

### Design

This section outlines the design process of the game system, starting from the user-centered use case model and progressing through architectural decomposition, class design, and behavioral modeling. Along the way, we reflect on key lessons and iterative improvements that shaped the final structure.

#### Use Case Model: From Player Perspective
![](docs/README/Use_Case_Model.png)

Our design began with constructing a use case model to capture the interactions between the player and the game system. As shown in the diagram, we identified core gameplay features such as **defeating monsters**, **opening chests**, **reading signs**, **entering the next level**, **adjusting settings**, and **viewing story scenes**. These use cases gave us a clear starting point: what the player can do and what the system must support.

Initially, our focus was narrowly placed on combat actions like defeating enemies or progressing levels. We neglected utility and narrative interactions such as settings adjustment or environmental reading. Later iterations added use cases like ‚ÄúRead Sign Content‚Äù and ‚ÄúPress ESC to Adjust Settings,‚Äù enhancing player immersion and control. Including contextual actors (e.g., Monster, Sign, Settings) further clarified responsibility boundaries, a valuable step for modular game logic.

#### Architectural Design: Modular Decomposition
![](./homework/week5/system_architecture.png)

Based on the use case model, we then designed a modular architecture to meet these functional requirements. The system is structured into several independent yet connected modules: **Core Entities**, **UI & HUD**, **Audio Manager**, **Level Manager**, and a centralized **Game Loop**. These modules run inside a browser environment, orchestrated via JavaScript and Phaser 3 library.

A practical lesson we learned here was the importance of **reverse mapping from use cases to modules**. For example, the ‚ÄúLevel Selection‚Äù case justified the Level Manager, while ‚ÄúAdjust Volume‚Äù motivated an independent Audio Manager. One critical improvement was centralizing the update() logic within the Game Loop. Early versions had entity-specific update methods called independently, which led to desynchronized rendering and inconsistent behavior. Refactoring to a centralized loop significantly improved stability and debuggability.


#### Class Design: Inheritance and Entity Specialization
![](./homework/week5/class_diagram.png)

![](./homework/week5/class_diagram_full.png)

With the system modules defined, we moved to class-level design. A core part of this was modeling the **Character** superclass, from which **Player**, **Enemy**, **Obstacle**, and **Projectile** inherit. Each subclass implements its specialized behavior while reusing shared logic such as movement, state management, and health tracking.

In our first attempt, we placed all logic in a monolithic `Entity` class to achieve reuse, but this led to bloated, unmanageable code. The move to a polymorphic hierarchy was a major breakthrough, improving maintainability and clarity. Each entity class (e.g., Enemy or Player) now encapsulates only the behaviors it owns, like patrol or shooting for enemies, and keyboard control for the player.

We also implemented reusable UI components like `Curtain` and `Prompt`, which were originally hardcoded into the game loop. Refactoring them into standalone classes with consistent display() and update() interfaces made them modular and extensible.

#### Level Configuration: Beyond Hardcoding

A critical turning point in our design thinking occurred during level design. At first, we hardcoded level layouts and enemy stats using embedded JSON files. This approach worked for prototyping but lacked scalability and flexibility.

Initially, we only focused on class inheritance for code reuse, and in terms of level design, we only thought of hardcoding configuration files. Later, we realized that **level configuration could serve as a parameterization tool**‚Äîby designing configuration files to define enemy types, positions, trigger zones, and even map styles, we could decouple gameplay logic from level content. This not only maximized code reuse but also empowered non-programmers to participate in level design by simply editing config files. This approach turned into a core strategy in our design: **code handles behavior, configuration defines variation**.

#### Sequence Modeling: Dynamic Behavior Over Time

![](./homework/week5/sequence_diagram.png)

To visualize how entities interact over time, we created sequence diagrams showing player and system interactions across the **Game**, **Level**, **Player**, and **Enemy** components. The diagram illustrates how starting a level triggers `init()` and `create()` methods, how player input results in movement or shooting, and how updates propagate through the game loop.

One lesson we learned here was the importance of consistent interfaces. By requiring each major entity to implement an `update()` method, we ensured they could all be synchronized in the game loop. Collision detection (`collisionCheck()`), rendering, and state transitions became easier to debug and extend.

#### Reflective Lessons and Design Techniques

Throughout this iterative design process, several key lessons emerged:

- **Start from user behavior**, not implementation. Designing from the player's perspective helped ensure gameplay was intuitive and feature-complete.
- **Abstract progressively**: move from high-level use cases to concrete modules, then into object-oriented classes and finally dynamic sequences.
- **Centralize game loop logic** to maintain update consistency across the system.
- **Favor configuration over hardcoding** for flexibility in level and gameplay tuning. This shift was crucial in making the game scalable.
- **Use interface unification** (e.g., common update(), display()) to enable polymorphic handling and simplify integration.

Each stage of the design involved rethinking and refactoring. Our initial plan emphasized inheritance for code reuse but ignored flexibility. By re-examining level design as a configuration-driven system and enforcing modular behaviors, we arrived at a structure that was both elegant and practical for long-term development.


### Implementation

To ensure that development remained focused and manageable, our team adopted a top-down implementation strategy, dividing the project into three primary domains:

- **Core combat system development**  
- **Level and progression integration**  
- **Art and visual design**

During the **first phase**, all members collaborated in **pair programming** mode to quickly establish a functional game demo. Agile stand-up meetings were held daily to align progress, share blockers, and re-evaluate priorities. This phase emphasized fast iteration, shared code ownership, and early discovery of architectural risks.

As we transitioned into the **second phase**, work became more specialized. The team split into **visual development** (responsible for environment art, UI, animations, and narrative illustration) and **code development** (handling combat mechanics, AI, system optimization). Integration checkpoints ensured continuous alignment across modules.

Despite the division of responsibilities, we encountered multiple **cross-domain challenges**‚Äîparticularly in aligning visual expectations with system limitations, or ensuring narrative and environment assets could support the intended gameplay mechanics. Below are **three representative implementation challenges**, each corresponding to one of the project‚Äôs top-level goals.

---

#### üß† Challenge 1: Dynamic Monster Behavior for Strategic Combat  
(Corresponding to: **Challenge and Growth**)

- **S (Situation)**  
  Static or passive enemies failed to provide a meaningful threat. To maintain tension and reward strategic thinking, we needed enemies to react intelligently to the player‚Äôs presence.

- **T (Task)**  
  The team was tasked with building monsters that could patrol autonomously and dynamically switch to an aggressive chase mode when players entered a detection radius. Pathfinding and obstacle avoidance were required for realistic movement.

- **A (Action)**  
  Patrol routes were defined via JSON, with a state machine controlling transitions between idle, patrol, and tracking. Detection radius triggered pursuit behavior, and a waypoint-based rerouting system was implemented to handle blocked paths or narrow corridors.

  üîÄ **Cross-domain Special Consideration**  
  During testing, monster patrol zones occasionally overlapped with **decorative tiles or foreground assets** placed by the art team that the engine didn‚Äôt recognize as obstacles. This caused unpredictable AI behavior. Since we were not using a full tilemap collision editor, the solution we adopted was pragmatic: **artists manually marked walkable and blocked tiles using an Excel sheet**, labeling positions and layers for each zone. While rudimentary, this approach created a shared communication layer that helped programmers configure collisions correctly based on artistic intent.

- **R (Result)**  
  The system introduced unpredictability and threat to enemy encounters. Players could no longer rely on fixed patterns, resulting in more adaptive and engaging combat. It also served as a foundation for future AI upgrades like group coordination or ranged tactics.

---

#### üîÅ Challenge 2: Player Transformation and Skill System  
(Corresponding to: **Challenge and Growth**)

- **S (Situation)**  
  To support meaningful progression and combat variety, we aimed to allow players to absorb and use abilities from defeated monsters. This would also reflect the narrative arc of internalizing enemy power.

- **T (Task)**  
  The team needed to design a modular transformation system, allowing players to temporarily take on new forms and skillsets while maintaining balance and performance.

- **A (Action)**  
  A shared `Character` superclass was used for both players and monsters. A modular `Ability` class encapsulated reusable skill data. When a player transformed, the system cached their base state and swapped in new attributes. Configuration files drove stat definitions and skill effects. The UI and animation were dynamically updated based on transformation state.

  üîÄ **Cross-domain Special Consideration**  
  Monster transformation required **distinct visual forms**, but the art team initially only produced static enemy sprites. To unblock development, the programming team implemented **placeholder effects**‚Äîlike glows and overlays‚Äîwhile artists prepared the final forms. This approach ensured parallel progress and avoided system bottlenecks due to pending assets.

- **R (Result)**  
  This system gave players a sense of tactical agency, letting them choose ability paths suited to their playstyle. It dramatically increased replayability and combat depth, and received highly positive feedback during test sessions.

#### üé® Challenge 3: Visual Storytelling Through Environment and Animation  
(Corresponding to: **Immersion and Narrative Progression**)

- **S (Situation)**  
  Cutscenes alone were insufficient to convey emotional progression. The team wanted players to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the story through changing environments and character visual feedback.

- **T (Task)**  
  Our task was twofold: (1) implement an animation system that reflected combat states clearly (e.g., hit, invincible, attack), and (2) embed narrative elements into environmental transitions using visual motifs and illustrations.

- **A (Action)**  
  The animation system used a timer-based `Animation` class to switch frames based on character status, including blinking for invincibility. Meanwhile, level artists developed four distinct environmental stages (Forest ‚Üí Graveyard ‚Üí Lake ‚Üí Lava), each with a specific color theme and narrative role. Comic-style panels were created to bridge stages, and interactive objects were themed accordingly (e.g., chained gates, cursed mist).

  üîÄ **Cross-domain Special Consideration**  
  Some visual proposals‚Äîlike **animated fog overlays or dynamic lava flows**‚Äîclashed with engine limitations, causing masking and performance issues. The teams coordinated to rework these as **parallax-safe static layers or looped effects**, and introduced strict conventions for asset layering and naming. This kept performance stable while preserving artistic impact.

- **R (Result)**  
  Visual feedback improved player decision-making and immersion. Environmental storytelling helped reinforce the world‚Äôs emotional arc without relying on dialogue. Players consistently commented on the atmospheric tension and narrative continuity between zones.

#### üìä Summary of Key Challenges and Outcomes

| Challenge | Goal | Solution | Cross-Domain Friction | Result |
|----------|------|----------|------------------------|--------|
| **Monster AI** | Increase tension and strategic depth | Patrol + Aggro system, rerouting with waypoints | Manual collision mapping via Excel to resolve art-program mismatches | More dynamic encounters, better challenge pacing |

| **Environment & Animation** | Deepen immersion and storytelling | Themed environments + responsive animation | Performance tuning due to animated visual layers | Strong narrative tone, enhanced player clarity |


### Evaluation

To evaluate whether our design and implementation successfully delivered an immersive, strategically challenging experience, we conducted a user-centered evaluation using both **qualitative** and **quantitative** methods. Specifically, we employed:

1. **Think-Aloud Protocols** ‚Äî to capture real-time user thoughts and frustrations during gameplay, guiding iterative design.
2. **NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX)** ‚Äî to quantitatively compare perceived cognitive and physical workload across levels.

This dual-method approach helped us refine key features, validate design assumptions, and align player experience with our stated top-level goals: **Challenge and Growth** and **Immersive Narrative Integration**.

---

#### üß† Think-Aloud Testing: Iterative Feedback and In-Game Adjustments

We invited a group of users, our classmates in fact, (N = 6) to play through the first two levels while narrating their thought process aloud. Sessions were recorded and tagged based on observed frustrations, expectations, surprises, and suggestions.

Key findings and responses included:

| **User Observation** | **Design Response** |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *‚ÄúI finished the level and nothing really happened... was that it?‚Äù* | üöÄ We added **level-clear animation and story recap panels** to create visual closure and narrative flow. |
| *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to tell if the monster sees me or not.‚Äù* | üëÅÔ∏è We plan to add **subtle sound and sprite cues** when enemies switch from idle to aggro. |
| *‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too hard. I didn‚Äôt know what I was supposed to do.‚Äù* | ‚ö†Ô∏è Added to the **‚ÄúCould Have‚Äù backlog**: contextual tips or hint popups during peak difficulty spikes. |
| *‚ÄúI like that I got a new ability, but I wasn‚Äôt sure how to use it.‚Äù* | üéØ We improved the **UI feedback for new abilities**, including an indicator and number hint. |

These observations directly influenced multiple polish and UX updates across all levels. The Think-Aloud approach also helped us identify **non-obvious pain points**, especially in transitions, ability clarity, and feedback consistency‚Äîareas which are difficult to surface via analytical method of ourselves.

#### üìä NASA-TLX Workload Comparison: Forest vs. Graveyard Levels

To evaluate the **cognitive and physical workload** imposed by our level design, we conducted a **within-subject** NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) assessment. Each participant (N = 6) completed both the **Forest (Level 1)** and **Graveyard (Level 2)** levels in sequence, then rated the workload dimensions immediately after each level.

##### Summary of Results:

| **Dimension** | **Forest (Level 1)** | **Graveyard (Level 2)** |
|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| Mental Demand | 42.5 | **71.3** üî∫ |
| Physical Demand | 25.2 | 33.0 |
| Temporal Demand | 36.1 | 65.4 |
| Effort | 44.8 | **70.1** üî∫ |
| Frustration | 28.0 | 40.7 |
| Performance (Reverse)| 55.5 | **67.2** üî∫ |

(*Scores normalized to 0‚Äì100 scale, higher = more intense*)

##### Interpretation:

The **Graveyard level introduced a dynamic vision-limiting mechanic**, simulating a cursed effect from the Chapter 1 boss. This constraint increased:
- **Mental load** (players needed to memorize or infer map layout)
- **Effort** (required more cautious movement and combat)
- **Temporal pressure** (due to ambush-prone design and reduced visibility)

Yet despite the added difficulty, players **reported higher satisfaction scores for perceived performance** in the Graveyard level, suggesting that the added challenge felt **earned rather than unfair**.

üîç **Conclusion:** 
The data confirms our design intent: the **vision-limiting mechanic successfully raised difficulty**, but also **deepened immersion and player satisfaction**‚Äîfulfilling our ‚ÄúImmersive Narrative‚Äù and ‚ÄúChallenge and Growth‚Äù requirements simultaneously.

---

#### ‚úÖ Evaluation Insights & Design Confirmation

Based on both qualitative feedback and quantitative workload data, we can conclude:

- Players want to be **challenged‚Äîbut with clarity**.
- Even subtle **narrative or visual cues** (e.g., animations, hint text) significantly improve onboarding and player confidence.
- Our **Level 2 vision mechanic** achieved the desired increase in difficulty without triggering frustration, validating its inclusion as a core mechanic.

This evaluation stage not only helped verify core design decisions, but also informed our roadmap priorities‚Äîfocusing future development on **enhanced feedback systems**, **adaptive challenge design**, and **optional hint mechanics**.


---

#### Code Testing

**Unit Testing** 
Throughout the development process, we conducted extensive unit testing on key game modules and features. Using the JUnit framework, we wrote over 200 test cases covering core mechanics, character systems, combat systems, item systems, and other aspects of the game. These test cases ensured that each independent module worked correctly before being integrated into the main game system.

**Integration Testing** 
After completing unit tests, we conducted integration testing to verify the compatibility of different modules working together. During this phase, we identified and fixed several cross-module compatibility issues, such as synchronization problems between character movement and collision detection, as well as state update issues between item usage and the combat system. These fixes ensured the stability and smoothness of the game.

**System Testing** 
Finally, we conducted system testing to assess the game's performance and compatibility across different platforms and devices. By simulating various user scenarios and extreme conditions, we verified the game's stability and response speed under various conditions. The system testing results showed that the game performed well on mainstream devices, but we also optimized it for low-end devices to ensure a broader user base could enjoy a good gaming experience.

#### Team Structure and Evolution

Our six-person game development team underwent a **natural evolution in collaboration structure**, transitioning from exploratory cooperation to a dual-track production model.

At the project‚Äôs outset, we aimed to follow a **classic Agile structure**, assigning hypothetical roles such as product owner, developer, and designer based on general principles. However, we soon realized that we **lacked a deep understanding of each other‚Äôs strengths, working preferences, and design instincts**. Early assignments revealed mismatches between skill sets and tasks, and strict roles occasionally constrained creativity and morale.

#### Phase 1: Unified Exploration Through Pair Programming (Before March 18)

In the initial phase, we agreed to **focus solely on building a working combat prototype**, postponing narrative, art, and polish. Our guiding principle was: **‚ÄúCode first, meaning later.‚Äù** This decision allowed all members to engage directly with the most abstract and difficult part of game development‚Äî**core gameplay logic**‚Äîwhile gradually forming a shared mental model of how the game could evolve.

We practiced **rotating pair programming**, forming dynamic pairs that collaborated on movement, shooting, and collision systems. This flexible approach helped us:
- Rapidly build a working **gameplay demo**;
- Cultivate empathy between designers and coders;
- Ensure every member gained baseline proficiency in front-end JS development.

Though we lacked a dedicated art pipeline, we reached a point where placeholders were necessary. At that time, we used **WeChat as a lightweight task board**, posting requests like "We need a basic enemy sprite to test aggro range." This strategy allowed us to **gauge interest and initiative**. Naturally, Xiao Wu, Yaxin Chen, and Yaoyao Shen began leading visual development tasks, while Jingwei Lin, Shaojie Yang, and Xinyi Zhou gravitated toward code.

This shared hands-on foundation proved invaluable later‚Äî**everyone could read and reason about code**, enabling better cross-domain communication down the line.

#### Phase 2: Formation of Two Interlocking Sub-Teams (After March 18)

Following the completion of our demo, we entered a more structured phase and naturally split into **two sub-teams**:

- **Visual Development Team**: Xiao Wu (narrative/story panels), Yaxin Chen (level/environment design), and Yaoyao Shen (transitional and UI visuals).
- **Software Engineering Team**: Shaojie Yang and Xinyi Zhou (main development pairs), with Jingwei Lin (developer-tester and design‚Äìengineering bridge).

##### Visual Development Team: Flexibility With Ownership

The visual team adopted a **modular, task-oriented approach** to content creation, maintaining consistent style across different story and interface components:
- Xiao Wu focused on **narrative cohesion**, designing story cutscenes and environmental storytelling cues.
- Yaxin Chen led **level mechanism ideation**, including cursed vision and stage-specific hazards.
- Yaoyao Shen specialized in **interface and transitional moments**, ensuring the emotional and functional bridge between gameplay scenes.

Though flexible, the team loosely followed the principles of **requirement engineering decomposition**: dividing story, interaction, and presentation roles across interdependent subsystems, often aligning with Acceptance Criteria defined earlier.

##### Engineering Team: Agile Execution and Cross-Syncing

The engineering team upheld a rigorous **pair programming model**, adhering to Agile principles:
- Daily standups ensured shared awareness and load balancing.
- Jira was used for tracking backlog items, tasks, and progress milestones.
- Continuous integration workflows enabled stable testing and deployment.
- Frequent code reviews maintained **code quality and shared knowledge**.

A special role emerged: **Jingwei Lin acted as the technical bridge** between design and development. While primarily focused on testing and system-level integration, Jingwei continuously **updated the visual team on the engine‚Äôs current capabilities**. This prevented overambitious ideas from being proposed before they were technically feasible, creating **mutual understanding between creativity and constraint**.

---

#### Reflections and Learnings

Looking back, our team structure reflects not rigid methodology, but **practical adaptability**:
- We **started without fixed roles**, discovering strengths through action rather than assumptions.
- We **unified around building something tangible first**, which grounded later abstract design decisions.
- We then **segmented along natural skill boundaries**, not top-down roles.
- Crucially, our **communication channels remained open and bi-directional**, with designers participating in code, and developers contributing to design thinking.

This hybrid model not only improved productivity but **enhanced mutual respect and cross-domain empathy**‚Äîwhich we believe is the cornerstone of any successful creative software project.

#### üåÄ Weekly Process and Sprint Rhythm

Our team followed a **weekly sprint-based development cycle**, combining structured Agile routines with natural team dynamics. The rhythm allowed us to concentrate collaboration, leave room for individual execution, and maintain a constant feedback loop.

#### üìÜ Weekly Development Schedule

| **Stage**               | **Activity Description**                                                                                                                                         | **Time Slot**                          | **Collaboration Outcome**                                 |

---

#### üß™ Practical Examples

- After completing the **demo in mid-March**, we used a Friday hiking session to sync on the **‚Äúcursed vision mechanic‚Äù**. This mechanic was then confirmed as a key feature in the Graveyard level, both technically feasible and narratively powerful.

- In another Friday reflection, we recognized that **‚Äúlevel-complete animations‚Äù** were missing. Following a team-wide discussion, we scheduled them for visual implementation and successfully enhanced the sense of progress and narrative continuity.

---

This rhythm allowed us to maintain a healthy balance between focused collaboration and flexible creativity‚Äîempowering both our **engineering and design sub-teams** to thrive while staying aligned.

### üßæ Conclusion

Looking back on the full development cycle of *Dragon Adventure*, our team reflects with both pride and humility. We began this journey with a clear creative ambition: to build a pixel-art action game that goes beyond fast-paced combat and introduces players to a meaningful, narrative-rich world. And while we achieved much of that vision, the path to it was nonlinear and filled with learning curves.

One of our greatest achievements was the **integration of narrative and gameplay**, which remains a rarity in the pixel shooter genre. Through features such as **vision-limiting mechanics**, **enemy ability inheritance**, and **environment-driven storytelling**, we created a world that responds to the player both mechanically and emotionally. Our Graveyard level in particular demonstrated how design innovations like fog of war can increase difficulty while also deepening immersion. Players not only overcame new mechanical challenges, but also felt the story tighten around them.

We also succeeded in realizing many of our key top-level goals from requirements engineering. Our user stories around *Challenge and Growth* led to modular systems like the **transformation mechanic**, which allowed players to tactically adapt by absorbing enemy skills. Meanwhile, the narrative integration criteria pushed us to implement visual transitions and lore-tied cutscenes that strengthened story continuity. These successes were validated in our **evaluation phase** through both **think-aloud studies** and **NASA-TLX** workload assessments, which confirmed that players felt a real increase in challenge and satisfaction from our design decisions.

But these highlights were only possible because of the solid foundation we built during the early technical phases. The game architecture, from a centralized game loop to modular `Character` classes and JSON-driven level configuration, enabled us to iterate rapidly while maintaining structural coherence. Our design philosophy of **‚Äúcode defines behavior, config defines variation‚Äù** gave the team‚Äîincluding non-programmers‚Äîthe ability to contribute meaningfully throughout the process.

That said, our journey was far from perfect. At the beginning, we had little concept of what software engineering truly required. We operated on instinct and informal coordination, often underestimating the importance of planning tools and structured workflows. It took us almost six weeks to build the prototype, which‚Äîwhile educational‚Äîleft us with less time for polish and extra features. As deadlines approached, we often found ourselves racing against time, forced to leave several valuable ideas (such as dynamic player hint systems or deeper branching narrative paths) in the backlog.

While our weekly Friday team-building sessions played an important role in team cohesion and project continuity, they were also our **only retrospective mechanism**. In contrast to standard Scrum practices‚Äîwhere *retrospective* and *review* meetings are formally distinct‚Äîwe combined both into casual discussions. Though emotionally supportive, this approach may have hindered deeper technical and stakeholder engagement. In hindsight, if we had reached out earlier to other teams, TAs, or even Ruzanna, we could have better utilized the **external support systems** available to us. Some important insights were simply realized too late to act on.

Through this experience, we also came to better understand ourselves as collaborators. By the project‚Äôs midpoint, we organically divided into specialized teams, improving both speed and morale. However, we acknowledge that our **collaboration tools were not always structured**, and task tracking could have been more rigorous. Learning from this, we are now better equipped to build high-functioning workflows from day one.

Going forward, we feel more confident as software developers and designers. We‚Äôve learned that great games aren't just the result of creativity but of disciplined iteration, collaborative compromise, and well-scaffolded architecture. In future versions or projects, we aim to build on our current systems by expanding feedback loops (e.g., rewards for ideal play), offering smarter in-game hints, and possibly developing deeper multiplayer or side-story modules that enrich the lore and increase replayability.

> In short, *Dragon Adventure* was not just a game we made ‚Äî it was the process through which we became a true game development team.
